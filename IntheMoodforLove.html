    <p> Considered as Wong Kar Wai's magnum opus, actors Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung return to star as Chow Mo-Wan and Su Li-Zhen respectively who move into neighboring apartments on the same day.
      At first, their encounters are polite and prim but when they unveil a secret about their spouses, they form a bond with each other that they promise to keep platonic as to not be like their unfaithful spouses but soon enough they find themselves falling in love with each other.
      Combining the graceful soundtrack with the masterful cinematography of Christopher Doyle, Wong Kar Wai crafts a heavily stylised film that despite not being dialogue-heavy, speaks so much. </p>
