    <p> In Wong Kar Wai's action/drama debut film, a mid-level gangster named Wah (Andy Lau) falls in love with his beautiful cousin, Ngor (played by the iconic Maggie Cheung) but must also protect his little brother and partner-in-crime Fly (Jacky Cheung) from the dangers of the gangster life.
      Wah finds himself having to choose between a flourishing relationship with his cousin and his obligation to protect his little brother from danger. Wong Kar Wai shows flashes of his signature style here with his daydream visuals and use of music.</p>
