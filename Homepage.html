    Wong Kar Wai has been one of the most defining directors not only in Hong Kong but around the world.
    The renowned auteur is known for his distinct style of directing that includes kinetic camerawork, heavy use of music, and

    Working  with key collaborators like actors Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung, and Takeshi Kaneshiro, and cinematographer Christopher Doyle,
    Wong Kar Wai has created films about love, loss, loneliness, heartbreak, and happiness such as <i> In the Mood for Love, Happy Together </i> and <i> Chungking Express</i> that evoke such strong emotions in the hearts of their viewers that leave them feeling either melancholy or joyous.
