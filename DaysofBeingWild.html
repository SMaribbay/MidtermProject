    <p> In Wong Kar Wai's sophomore film, we see his signature style begin to bloom. Set in 1960, a man named Yuddy (Leslie Cheung) learns from the ex-prostitute who raised him that she is not his real mother which shakes him to his core.
      On top of dealing with this revelation, two women start to fall for him but he only lets them fight over him. Once Yuddy learns of his mother's identity (Maggie Cheung), he abandons everything and everyone around him and sets out to the Philippines to find her.
    This marks Wong Kar Wai's first collaboration with cinematographer Christopher Doyle and actor Tony Leung who appears briefly in the film. </p>
