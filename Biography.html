    Wong Kar Wai is a Chinese film director, screenwriter, and producer who was born in Shanghai in 1957 and moved to Hong Kong with his family in 1963.
    Like many other Shanghainese, Wong had a rather difficult time assimilating to Hong Kong culture and and dialect. Struggling to communicate with other people, Wong turned to cinema as his refuge.
    As Wong grew as a film enthusiast, the Hong Kong New Wave in cinema where young directors would stray away from conventional filmmaking ideas and created their own unique work.
    These experiences growing up left a lasting impression on Wong as can be seen in someo of his films that are set in the 1960s.
    Wong studied graphic design at Hong Kong Polytechnic where he took  course for prospective production designers and directors at the television network TVB.
    His first job was as a screenwriter where he was mentored by director Tam and assisted him in writing the screenplay for one of his films in 1987.
    Soon after, Wong directed his debut film in 1988 and his career has taken off since then.
