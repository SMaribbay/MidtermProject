    <p> Wong Kar Wai blends the languid atmosphere of his previous film with a non-linear sci-fi twist. Tony Leung reprises his role as Chow Mo-wan who now tries to fill the void in his heart that his previous lover has left him with by dating other women which is ultimately fruitless.
      These experiences with these women form the plot of his new novel about an elusive train, which includes a mysterious woman played by Faye Wong, that is headed towards a place called 2046. Wong Kar Wai once again collaborates with cinematographer Christopher Doyle to create breathtaking and dizzying visuals that propel and heighten this futuristic love story. </p>
